# TMDB top 5000 Film Primary Genre Prediction using Classification Models
This study utilizes the TMDB 5000 movie dataset from The Movie Database that has about 23 features including, title, budget, genre, keywords, popularity, homepage, and other relevant features
Our aim is to explore different models to accurately predict genres based on different attributes. 
To achieve this, we used different models including KNN, Logistic Regression, Neural Network, Random Forest Classifier, XGC Boost Classifier and Support Vector Machine Classifiers. 
By leveraging the rich metadata available for this movie, the models can predict and place each on different genres, with different accuracies depending on the model used. The effectiveness of the models is gauged by the accuracy score metric
